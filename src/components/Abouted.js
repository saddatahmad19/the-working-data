                    Our in-house proprietary software allows us to scale up without exponentially 
                    increasing our computing costs. We understand that just because a model worked 
                    great a year ago doesnâ€™t mean it will work a year from now. This is why we believe 
                    in continuously monitoring models to ensure they give valuable insight and allow you 
                    to make changes when they are no longer helpful. Think of us as your in-house data science team.
